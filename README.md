# Companies House EI Connector

The Companies House [Connector](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI640/Working+with+Connectors) allows you to access the [Companies House REST API](https://developer.companieshouse.gov.uk/api/docs/index/gettingStarted.html) through WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (WSO2 EI). The Companies House API lets you retrieve information about limited companies (and other companies that fall within the Companies Act 2006). The data returned is live and realÂ­time, and is simple to use and understand.
